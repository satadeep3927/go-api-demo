We’ve heard of the platforms we use every day and we know data is a critical part of their success. But do we know who else is profiting from our digital lives?

With indirect impacts like this, the harms of data brokerage could be far greater, not least from sensitive personal data moving between hands. As Sherman highlighted in Wired last year, “entire databases of citizen information are ready for purchase, whether to predatory loan companies, law enforcement agencies, or even malicious foreign actors”.↵↵We have some sense of their practices, of gathering data from individuals or from the companies and sites they own, of buying, repackaging, licensing and selling data profiles of people (often of dubious accuracy).
